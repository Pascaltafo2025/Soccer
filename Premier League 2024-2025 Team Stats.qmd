# APPROACH

## Comparing expeting goals attempts and team ranking

I will begin by creating a table object of the Premier League statistics data from the 2024-2025 season that i will pull down the csv file from a public repo in my github using a function in the **gt package** . Then i will will be to focus on the top 5 teams and conduct an exploratory data analysis to identify a possible **correlation** between the expected goals attempts (**xG: a metric of scoring opportunity quality**) of these 5 teams and their final position at the end of the season.
